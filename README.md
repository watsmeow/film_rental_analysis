# File Rental Business Analysis
Rockbuster, a film rental company renting physical films through brick-and-mortar stores, needs to better understand their business in order to create a plan to go digital.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** PostgreSQL, Tableau, Excel

I harnessed the power of analytics to assist Rockuster in answering questions about their current business using a combination of analytical tools and tech, including SQL, Tableau, Excel, and PowerPoint.

## Deliverable

A comprehensive and compelling report of data insights, Tableau visualizations, and business suggestions, a data dictionary, and a reference guide of SQL queries and outputs used to mine the data for the insights discovered.

## Lessons Learned:

- Conduct analyses to determine the geographic distribution of customersâ€™ preferences for each film category.
- This dataset was not timestamped in a way that was conducive to time series analysis, but I would attempt to use the record update timestamps in the database to give a historical analysis of revenue trends.
- Leverage my knowledge of Python to further analyze data retrieved from querying the database with SQL.
I believe it's important to have a dedicated retrospective once a project is completed. Having a process for evaluating a project's ability to meet goals, what contributed to it's success or failure, and what lessons can be learned and applied to future projects is a key component of iterative improvement.
